# This script performs the building of the Apps provided by this project,
# including the building of all of their dependencies. The built Apps packages
# (both .CRX files and .ZIP archives suitable for uploading at Chrome WebStore
# - see <https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish>) are put into the
# built_app_packages/ directory.
#
# Note: the env must be initialized and the env/activate script must be source'd
# into the shell before executing this script.
#
# For the building prerequisites, refer to the README file.
