# * The target for the .a file depends on the input .o object files, so that

# Implementation notes:
# * The target consists of three resulting files: .wasm, .js, .worker.js. The
#   first one is the actual binary, the second one is a JavaScript code that
#   loads it, and the third one is used for the Pthreads multi-threading
#   support.
# * The "%" character is used as a trick to tell Make run the recipe only once
#   in order to produce all three files (technically, "%" means it's a pattern
#   rule, and in this case it's matching to a single dot "."). Note: in
#   Make >=4.3 there's a more intuitive alternative (the "&:" rules), but at the
#   moment Make 4.3 isn't widespread enough.
# * The target depends on the input .o object files and .a static library files,
#   so that recompilation of those triggers re-linking.
# * The target also has an order-only dependency on the dir.stamp file, in order

# * The linking is performed via Emscripten Compiler Frontend (emcc).
# * The targets are added as a dependency to the "all" target, so that they're
#   built by default when no target is specified explicitly in the command line.

# Implementation notes:
# * On Emscripten, the files that need to be exposed to the executable module
#   have to be packaged ("preloaded") into a .data file. This happens during the
#   linking stage, hence this macro only modifies the variables that are used by
#   LINK_EXECUTABLE_RULE.
# * The "@" character in Emscripten's CLI syntax is a separator between input
#   and output paths; we also have to strip the arguments to avoid accidental
#   spaces around it.
# * We also add a dependency on the "copy_emscripten_data_to_out" helper target
#   that copies the .data file created during linking into the "out" folder.
