# Flags passed to the Emscripten compiler and linker tools.

# Explanation:
# bind: Enables "Embind" (the technology used by our C++ wrappers for talking
#   with JavaScript).
# pthread: Enables Pthreads support (for C/C++ multi-threading, etc.).
# DISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING: Enable support for C++ exceptions.

#
# Explanation:
# ABORTING_MALLOC: Immediately abort on memory allocation failures (instead of
#   letting malloc and similar return null, which is the default behavior with
#   ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1).
# ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH: Increase the amount of available memory dynamically at
#   runtime (as opposed to be capped by the default limit of 16 MiB).
# DYNAMIC_EXECUTION: Disable dynamic code execution in Emscripten JavaScript
#   code (not doing this will cause "unsafe-eval" Content Security Policy
#   violations when running this code inside Chrome Apps/Extensions).
# EXPORT_NAME: Name of the JavaScript function that loads the Emscripten module.
# MODULARIZE: Puts Emscripten module JavaScript loading code into a factory
#   function, in order to control its loading from other JS code and to avoid
#   name conflicts with unrelated code.
# no-pthreads-mem-growth: Suppress the linker warning about the performance of

# Implementation notes:
# * The target for the .o file depends on the source file, so that modification
#   of the source file triggers recompilation.
# * The target also has an order-only dependency on the dir.stamp file, in order
#   to guarantee that the parent directory is created by the compilation time.
# * The compilation is performed via the Emscripten Compiler Frontend (emcc).
# * The target is added as a dependency to the "all" target, so that it's built
#   by default when no target is specified explicitly in the command line.
# * The dependency file is additionally included if it exists (generated during
#   the previous compilation due to the "-MMD" flag described below), allowing
#   to automatically trigger recompilation when some used header has changed.
#
# Explanation of parameters to emcc:
# o: Path to store the output .o file.
# c: Generate bitcode, rather than all artifacts including JavaScript.
# MMD, MP: Additionally generate the dependency file, containing information
#   about all files used by this file, i.e., all headers transitively included
#   by it. The dependency file is generated in the makefile syntax, allowing to
#   simply include this file into our makefile. System headers are not included
#   into the dependency file.

#
# Implementation notes:
# * The target for the .a file depends on the input .o object files, so that
#   recompilation of those triggers re-linking.
# * The recipe starts from ensuring the LIB_DIR exists.
# * The recipe also deletes the previously existing .a file, if any, in order to
#   prevent accidental reuse of old archive contents after the rebuild.
# * The linking is performed via the Emscripten "emar" (drop-in replacement for
#   the standard "ar" program).
# * The target is added as a dependency to the "all" target, so that it's built
#   by default when no target is specified explicitly in the command line.
#
# Explanation of parameters to emar:

# Implementation notes:
# * The target consists of three resulting files: .wasm, .js, .worker.js. The
#   first one is the actual binary, the second one is a JavaScript code that
#   loads it, and the third one is used for the Pthreads multi-threading
#   support. The "&" character denotes that all three files are produced by a
#   single invocation of the recipe.
# * The target depends on the input .o object files and .a static library files,
#   so that recompilation of those triggers re-linking.
# * The target also has an order-only dependency on the dir.stamp file, in order
#   to guarantee that the parent directory is created by the compilation time.
# * The linking is performed via Emscripten Compiler Frontend (emcc).
# * The targets are added as a dependency to the "all" target, so that they're
#   built by default when no target is specified explicitly in the command line.
# * The COPY_TO_OUT_DIR_RULE macro is used to copy the resulting files into the
#   "out" directory where they can be loaded by the resulting Chrome
#   App/Extension.
