# Common documentation for definitions provided by this file (they are
# implemented in toolchain-specific .mk files, but share the same interface):
#
# * TEST_ADDITIONAL_CXXFLAGS:
#   Additional flags to be specified when compiling test files.
#
# * TEST_ADDITIONAL_LDFLAGS:
#   Additional flags to be specified when linking the resulting executable.
#
# * TEST_RUNNER_SOURCES:
#   Test runner's own C/C++ sources to be linked into the resulting executable.
#
# * TEST_RUNNER_LIBS:
#   Test runner's own static libraries to be linked into the resulting
#   executable.
#
# * TEST_RUNNER_DEPS:
#   Test runner's own dependencies that need to be added as prerequisites for
#   the linking of the resulting executable.
#
# * run_test:
#   A target that executes the tests.
