// The time window, during which the crashes are counted and compared against
// |CRASH_LOOP_THRESHOLD_COUNT|.
const CRASH_LOOP_WINDOW_MILLISECONDS = 60 * 1000;
// If the number of crashes reaches this constant within the
// |CRASH_LOOP_WINDOW_MILLISECONDS| time window, then it's considered to be a
// crash loop.
//
// Note that |CRASH_LOOP_WINDOW_MILLISECONDS| and |CRASH_LOOP_THRESHOLD_COUNT|
// have to be chosen in a way that the crash loop is detected earlier than
// Chrome starts to throttle us, since that would leave the application in a
// state without any useful logs.
//
// As of 2021-06-07, two subsystems in Chrome have to be taken into account as
// follows:
// 1. Chrome's Extension system disables the extension when it reloads too
//    frequently, with the criteria currently being "5 reloads, each within 10
//    seconds after the launch":
//    <https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/extensions/api/runtime/chrome_runtime_api_delegate.cc;l=172-173;drc=d17745f350d4956a07cb1113ee19e9cbc4be699f>.
// 2. Chrome's Native Client system disables the module when it crashes too
//    frequently, with the criteria currently being "forbid subsequent load
//    attempts after 3 crashes within 2 minutes":
//    <https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/nacl/browser/nacl_browser.cc;l=113-114;drc=d17745f350d4956a07cb1113ee19e9cbc4be699f>.
//
// We're choosing the largest possible value that satisfies these restrictions
// in order to reduce the risk of false positives, i.e., 3. Note that despite
// this value is exactly equal to restriction#2, it's still fine, since
// throttling breaks subsequent load attempts, which is exactly what we avoid.
