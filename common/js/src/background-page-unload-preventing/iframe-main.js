/**
 * @fileoverview Entry point of the main script in the background page unload
 * preventing iframe.
 *
 * By default, App's background page gets automatically unloaded by Chrome after
 * some period of inactivity (see
 * <https://developer.chrome.com/apps/event_pages>). In order to suppress such
 * behavior, an iframe with this script can be created from the background
 * page. The script opens a Port that connects to the same App (the other end
 * should be handled in the background page). Keeping the Port opened prevents
 * the background page from being unloaded.
