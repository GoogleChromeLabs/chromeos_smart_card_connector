 * Emitted when deserialization sees a TypedAst with semantic errors.

 * the tool that generated the serialized data is faulty.
 *
 * <p>This exception says nothing about the byte-level encoding or parsing of the input data.
 * Instead, it means that TypedAst parsed from those bytes can't be translated into the compiler's
