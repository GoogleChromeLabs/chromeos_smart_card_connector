/**
 * Class that allows to flexibly manage what to do with a reported warning/error.
 *
 * <p>Guard has several choices: - return OFF - suppress the warning/error - return WARNING - return
 * ERROR report it with high severity - return null. Does not know what to do with it. Lets the
 * other guard decide what to do with it.
 *
 * <p>Although the interface is very simple, it allows you easily customize what warnings you are
 * interested in.
 *
 * <p>For example there are could be several implementations: StrictGuard - {return ERROR}. All
 * warnings should be treat as errors. SilentGuard - {if (WARNING) return OFF}. Suppress all
 * warnings but still fail if JS has errors. AllowlistGuard (if !allowlistErrors.contains(error)
 * return ERROR) return error if it does not present in the allowlist.
