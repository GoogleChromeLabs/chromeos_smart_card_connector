   * properties also don't need to be tracked across that edge either. Of course, since we don't

   * <p>This graph, when fully constructed, is still only an approximation. This is the due to both
   * memory and time constraints. The following quirks are expected:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Some colors, such as primitives, will not have nodes.
   *   <li>Transitive edges (shortcut edges for which there exist alternate paths) are kept minimal.

   * <p>In practice, this could be declared as taking an {@link EdgeReason} instead of an Object,
   * but Object is used to indicate that EdgeReasons are only meant for debugging and not any actual
   * logic in (dis)ambiguation.
