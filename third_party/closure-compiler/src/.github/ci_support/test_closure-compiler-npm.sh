# Download and test closure-compiler-npm using the compiler from this commit.
#
# Requirements:
#   - PWD = closure-compiler-npm repo root
#
# Params:
#   1. File name of compiler_unshaded_deploy.jar
function main() {
  local compiler_jar="$1"

  # Download all NPM deps to "node_modules".
  yarn install

  # Copy the version of the compiler built as a pre-requisite of this script
  # into closure-compiler-npm. The NPM repo normally builds the compiler itself,
  # and puts the binary in these locations, so we're superceeding that here.
  #
  # Make sure to copy after yarn install so that the files don't get cleaned up.
  #
  # TODO(nickreid): This should be done using scripts from inside the NPM repo

  cp "${compiler_jar}" "packages/google-closure-compiler-windows/compiler.jar"

  # Run all the tests inside closure-compiler-npm. This will use the version
  # of the compiler we just copied into it.
  #
  # The NPM repo is divided into multiple Yarn workspaces: one for each
  # variant of the compiler, including the Graal native builds.
