The [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) is a
tool for making JavaScript download and run faster. It is a true compiler for
JavaScript. Instead of compiling from a source language to machine code, it
compiles from JavaScript to better JavaScript. It parses your JavaScript,
analyzes it, removes dead code and rewrites and minimizes what's left. It also
checks syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common JavaScript
pitfalls.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to install the compiler is with [NPM](https://npmjs.com) or
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```bash
yarn global add google-closure-compiler
# OR
npm i -g google-closure-compiler
```

The package manager will link the binary for you, and you can access the
compiler with:

```bash
google-closure-compiler
```

This starts the compiler in interactive mode. Type:

```javascript
var x = 17 + 25;
```

Hit `Enter`, then `Ctrl+Z` (on Windows) or `Ctrl+D` (on Mac/Linux), then `Enter`
again. The Compiler will respond with the compiled output (using `SIMPLE` mode
by default):

```javascript
var x=42;
```

#### Downloading from Maven Repository

A pre-compiled release of the compiler is also available via
[Maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.javascript/closure-compiler).

### Basic usage

The Closure Compiler has many options for reading input from a file, writing
output to a file, checking your code, and running optimizations. Here is a
simple example of compressing a JS program:

```bash
google-closure-compiler --js file.js --js_output_file file.out.js
```

We get the **most benefit** from the compiler if we give it **all of our source
code** (see [Compiling Multiple Scripts](#compiling-multiple-scripts)), which
allows us to use `ADVANCED` optimizations:

```bash
google-closure-compiler -O ADVANCED rollup.js --js_output_file rollup.min.js
```

To see all of the compiler's options, type:

```bash
google-closure-compiler --help
```

#### See the [Google Developers Site](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/gettingstarted_app) for documentation including instructions for running the compiler from the command line.

### NodeJS API

You can access the compiler in a JS program by importing
`google-closure-compiler`:

```javascript
import closureCompiler from 'google-closure-compiler';
const { compiler } = closureCompiler;

new compiler({
  js: 'file-one.js',
  compilation_level: 'ADVANCED'
});
```

This package will provide programmatic access to the native Graal binary in most
cases, and will fall back to the Java version otherwise.

#### Please see the [closure-compiler-npm](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler-npm/tree/master/packages/google-closure-compiler) repository for documentation on accessing the compiler in JS.

## Compiling Multiple Scripts

If you have multiple scripts, you should compile them all together with one
compile command.

```bash
google-closure-compiler in1.js in2.js in3.js --js_output_file out.js
```

You can also use minimatch-style globs.

```bash
# Recursively include all js files in subdirs
google-closure-compiler 'src/**.js' --js_output_file out.js

# Recursively include all js files in subdirs, excluding test files.
# Use single-quotes, so that bash doesn't try to expand the '!'
google-closure-compiler 'src/**.js' '!**_test.js' --js_output_file out.js
```

The Closure Compiler will concatenate the files in the order they're passed at
the command line.

If you're using globs or many files, you may start to run into problems with
managing dependencies between scripts. In this case, you should use the
[Closure Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/). It contains
functions for enforcing dependencies between scripts, and Closure Compiler will
re-order the inputs automatically.

## Getting Help

1.  Post in the
    [Closure Compiler Discuss Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/closure-compiler-discuss).
2.  Ask a question on
    [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-closure-compiler).
3.  Consult the [FAQ](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/FAQ).

## Building the Compiler

To build the compiler yourself, you will need the following:

Prerequisite                                                               | Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------
[Java 8 or later](https://java.com)                                        | Used to compile the compiler's source code.
[Git](https://git-scm.com/)                                                | Used by Bazel to download dependencies.
[Bazelisk](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-bazelisk.html) | Used to build the various compiler targets.

### Installing Bazelisk

Bazelisk is a wrapper around Bazel that dynamically loads the appropriate
version of Bazel for a given repository. Using it prevents spurious errors that
result from using the wrong version of Bazel to build the compiler, as well as
makes it easy to use different Bazel versions for other projects.

Bazelisk is available through many package managers. Feel free to use whichever
you're most comfortable with.

[Instructions for installing Bazelisk](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-bazelisk.html).

### Building from a terminal

You can trigger the build process easily with package.json scripts or by calling
Bazel manually.

```bash
# bazelisk build //:compiler_unshaded_deploy.jar
yarn build

# bazelisk build :all
yarn build:all
```

### Testing from a terminal

Tests can be executed in a similar way. The following command will run all tests
in the repo.

```bash
# bazelisk test //:all
```

There are hundreds of individual test targets, so it will take a few
minutes to run all of them. While developing, it's usually better to specify
the exact tests you're interested in.

```bash
bazelisk test //:$path_to_test_file
```

### Building from an IDE

See [Bazel IDE Integrations](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/ide.html).

### Running

Once the compiler has been built, the compiled JAR will be in the `bazel-bin/`
directory. You can access it with a call to `java -jar ...` or by using the
package.json script:

```bash
# java -jar bazel-bin/compiler_unshaded_deploy.jar [...args]
yarn compile [...args]
```

#### Running using Eclipse

1.  Open the class `src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CommandLineRunner.java` or
    create your own extended version of the class.
2.  Run the class in Eclipse.
3.  See the instructions above on how to use the interactive mode - but beware
    of the
    [bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4711098/passing-end-of-transmission-ctrl-d-character-in-eclipse-cdt-console)
    regarding passing "End of Transmission" in the Eclipse console.

keep our community a healthy and welcoming place.

### Reporting a bug

1.  First make sure that it is really a bug and not simply the way that Closure
    Compiler works (especially true for ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS).
    *   Check the
        [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)
    *   Consult the [FAQ](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/FAQ)
    *   Search on
        [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-closure-compiler)
        and in the
        [Closure Compiler Discuss Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/closure-compiler-discuss)
    *   Look through the list of
        [compiler assumptions](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Compiler-Assumptions).
2.  If you still think you have found a bug, make sure someone hasn't already
    reported it. See the list of
    [known issues](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues).
3.  If it hasn't been reported yet, post a new issue. Make sure to add enough
    detail so that the bug can be recreated. The smaller the reproduction code,
    the better.

### Suggesting a feature

1.  Consult the [FAQ](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/FAQ) to
    make sure that the behaviour you would like isn't specifically excluded
    (such as string inlining).
2.  Make sure someone hasn't requested the same thing. See the list of
    [known issues](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues).
3.  Read up on
    [what type of feature requests are accepted](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-submit-a-feature-request-for-a-new-type-of-optimization).
4.  Submit your request as an issue.

### Submitting patches

1.  All contributors must sign a contributor license agreement (CLA). A CLA
    basically says that you own the rights to any code you contribute, and that
    you give us permission to use that code in Closure Compiler. You maintain
    the copyright on that code. If you own all the rights to your code, you can
    fill out an
    [individual CLA](https://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html). If
    your employer has any rights to your code, then they also need to fill out a
    [corporate CLA](https://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html). If
    you don't know if your employer has any rights to your code, you should ask
    before signing anything. By default, anyone with an @google.com email
    address already has a CLA signed for them.
2.  To make sure your changes are of the type that will be accepted, ask about
    your patch on the
    [Closure Compiler Discuss Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/closure-compiler-discuss)
3.  Fork the repository.
4.  Make your changes. Check out our
    [coding conventions](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Contributors#coding-conventions)
    for details on making sure your code is in correct style.
5.  Submit a pull request for your changes. A project developer will review your
    work and then merge your request into the project.
