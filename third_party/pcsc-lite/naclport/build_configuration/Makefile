# This makefile runs the PC/SC-Lite's "bootstrap" and "configure" scripts, in
# order to prepare autogenerated headers that are used by our webports of
# PS/SC-Lite and CCID.
#
# Note that we don't take the "CONFIG"/"TOOLCHAIN"/etc. environment variables
# into account, since the steps performed here don't depend on these and should
# only be executed once.

# Define the default target (executed when running "make" without any extra
# arguments). Redirect the actual work to the "build.stamp" helper.
.PHONY: all
all: build.stamp

# The helper "build.stamp" target performs the needed commands whenever
# something in the ../../src folder (where PC/SC-Lite's original sources are) is
# changed.
#
# Before running the build, we clean old build artifacts. On completion, the
# target creates build.stamp that allows Make to track file timestamps and
# detect changes.
build.stamp: $(shell find ../../src)
	@rm -f build.stamp
	@git clean -fX ../../src
	cd ../../src && ./bootstrap && ./configure
	@touch build.stamp

# Delete the stamp and PC/SC-Lite temporary build artifacts on "make clean".
