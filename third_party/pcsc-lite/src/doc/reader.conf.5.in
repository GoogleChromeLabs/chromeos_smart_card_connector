.TH READER.CONF 5 "December 2021" Muscle "PC/SC Lite"
.SH NAME
reader.conf \- configuration file for pcscd readers' drivers
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I @PCSCLITE_CONFIG_DIR@/*
files contain configuration information for serial and (some) PCMCIA
smart card readers.
.PP
USB readers SHALL NOT be configured using these files.
.B pcscd
uses another mechanism to automatically load USB drivers.
.
.SH SYNTAX
The
.I @PCSCLITE_CONFIG_DIR@/*
files are regular text file. Each reader must be defined by four fields:
.PP
 FRIENDLYNAME     TEXT_STRING
 DEVICENAME       FILENAME
 LIBPATH          FILENAME
 CHANNELID        NUMBER
.PP
The "FRIENDLYNAME" field is an arbitrary text used to identify the
reader. This text is displayed by commands like
.BR pcsc_scan (1)
that prints the names of all the connected and detected readers.
.PP
The "DEVICENAME" field was not used for old drivers (using the IFD
handler version 2.0 or earlier). It is now (IFD handler version 3.0) used
to identify the physical port on which the reader is connected. This
is the device name of this port. It is dependent of the OS kernel. The
first serial port device is called
.I /dev/ttyS0
under Linux and
.I /dev/cuaa0
under FreeBSD.
.PP
The "LIBPATH" field is the filename of the driver code. The driver is
a dynamically loaded piece of code (generally a
.IR drivername.so.*
file).
.PP
The "CHANNELID" is no more used for recent drivers (IFD handler 3.0) and
has been superseded by "DEVICENAME". If you have an old driver this
field is used to indicate the port to use. You should read your driver
documentation to know what information is needed here. It should be the
serial port number for a serial reader.
.
.SH EXAMPLE
 # Gemplus GemPCTwin reader with serial communication
 # connected to the first serial port
 FRIENDLYNAME      "GemPCTwin serial"
 DEVICENAME        /dev/ttyS0
 LIBPATH           @usbdropdir@/serial/libccidtwin.so.0.4.1
 CHANNELID         1
.
.SH DEBUGGING
In order to set up your
.I @PCSCLITE_CONFIG_DIR@/my_reader.conf
file correctly you may want to have debug messages from
.BR pcscd .
I recommend you to start
.B pscsd
in the foreground and debug mode using:
 # pcscd \-\-foreground \-\-debug
.PP
If everything seems OK you can use the
.B pcsc_scan
command to print the list of correctly detected readers and try to get
the ATR of your smart cards.
