IPython Kernel for Native Client
===============================

This package runs an IPython kernel inside Native Client.
It creates a Native Client binary, and support files that
must be available to the binary via HTTP.  Running this
Native Client binary inside Chrome, runs an IPython kernel.

Communication with the kernel is done by Pepper messaging,
not by ZeroMQ.  This is accomplished by making modifications
to the IPython Kernel.  Users call postMessage from JavaScript,
and listening for the replies.  Messages follow essentially the
same pattern as the IPython messaging system.
