NOTE: libgc for Native Client has been modified to support cooperative 
      thread parking for multi-threaded programs.  If you plan on using
      more than one thread with this implementation of libgc, make sure
      to pass -finstrument-for-thread-suspension to nacl-gcc or your
      program will probably hang on the first garbage collection.
