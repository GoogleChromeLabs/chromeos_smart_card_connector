HDF5 relies on a number of POSIX commands and conventions that are not
necessarily supported in Native Client (as of pepper_34).  The changes made
here include a pre-generated H5Tinit.c, run inside sel_ldr on x86_64, that
creates the "native" datatypes, and a H5lib_settings.c also run inside sel_ldr.
The options in config.site were computed by manually extracting the test
programs from configure.ac and executing them inside sel_ldr, where some
surprising results for number rounding were found.

The only file driver known to work in sec2, which may behave strangely
depending on the file system being used.  Note that support for truncate is
required, and a hack for computing inodes of files for internal reference
counts (to prevent collision) has been implemented.
