Major Changes for port findutils:
1. disabled the check for mnttab
   changed gnulib/m4/ls-mntd-fs.m4

2. fixed time_t related issue

	had an complie issue like this:
	>>getdate.y:118: negative width in bit-field
    >>`verify_error_if_negative_size__'
    >>The line in question is
    >>verify (LONG_MIN <= TYPE_MINIMUM (time_t) 
        && TYPE_MAXIMUM (time_t) <= LONG_MAX);
    disabled this verify.

    also there is an complie error in gnulib/lib/mktime.c, 
    fixed by getting the following files from the gnulib repo:

    http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=tree;f=lib; \
    h=c30852beffcfcdd47da3cfbd7af8cae7c950ad94; \
    hb=233419c39c6d13d84439b95766328a238ffb6518
    
    gnulib/lib/mktime.c 
    gnulib/lib/mktime-internal.h gnulib/m4/mktime.m4 
    Todo: We might need port gnulib in the future

3. a few macro to make findutils include the header file in nacl include 
  instead of header file in gnulib

4. changed the link line in the make file

5. find.c ftsfind.c  added "nalc_main"

6. comment out the mount logic in gnulib/lib/mountlist.c

7. lib/buildcmd.c 
   added macro _POSIX_ARG_MAX
