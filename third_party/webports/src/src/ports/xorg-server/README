This port of xorg-server is an amalgam of stock X11R7.7 and an android
SDL port of an earlier version from:
  https://github.com/pelya/xserver-xsdl.git
  at 3cce1acc1f943ded8491e1be814aebfce6e09023
From which we've borrowed:
  sdl.c
  Makefile.am

The port has been modified to:
  - Remove android-ism.
  - Work with the autoconf build instead of an ant build (by only
    cherry-picking the SDL work without other changes).
  - Ignore unicode and pass along raw key events.
