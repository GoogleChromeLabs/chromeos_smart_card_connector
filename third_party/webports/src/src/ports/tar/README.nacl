We are intentionally using an old version of GNU tar. nacl_io
does not have openat as of January 2014 and more recent releases of
GNU tar heavily uses it. Note that you should be able to remove
nacl.patch if you can update the version of GNU tar.

The build of this package failed with newlib, so currently this port
is glibc only.
