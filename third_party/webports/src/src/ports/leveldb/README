leveldb port to Native Client
=============================

This port pulls code directly from git since leveldb stopped
publishing tarball releases on code.google.com with 1.15.0.

While code.google.com does support automatic archives using
URLs like 'https://leveldb.googlecode.com/archive/e353fbc.tar.gz'
it seems that these do not have consistent hashes and so we
can't use them in naclports.
