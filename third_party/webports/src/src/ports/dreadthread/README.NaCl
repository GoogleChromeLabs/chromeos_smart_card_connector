Renamed from pico to dreadthread due to project name collision.

pico thread library's support for non-blocking I/O via pico_select was
removed, since NaCl does not provide a select, poll, or epoll system
calls.  Signal blocking/unblocking code was similarly removed, since
NaCl doesn't have signals.
