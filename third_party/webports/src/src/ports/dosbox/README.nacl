DOSBox for NaCl
===============

This port of DOSBox to NaCl enables running on legacy DOS
application withing chrome.  Its is based on the NaCl SDL
port.

In order to load applications into the system the dosbox
'mount' command must be used to export part of the NaCl
virtual filesystem to dosbox. e.g::

  $ mount c /path/to/app

This command will mount the contents of /path/to/app as
the DOS C: drive.

Tar files can be extract into the NaCl VFS by setting the
sdl_mount_http attribute on the NaCl embed tag. e.g::

  sdl_tar_extract="/mnt/http/myapp.tar:/myapp"

This attribute tells SDL to extra the file app.tar (which
should live alongside the html file on the web server) to
/app in the NaCl virtual filesystem.  Then the following
commands can be entered to run the app within dosbox:

 $ mount c /myapp
 $ c:
 $ myapp.exe
