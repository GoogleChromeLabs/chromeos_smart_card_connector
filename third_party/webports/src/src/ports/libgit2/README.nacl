This port of libgit2 has been extended with a new transport layer. Normally
libgit2 uses POSIX sockets to communicate with remote git servers. These APIs
are available in Pepper (via nacl_io), but can only be used with Chrome Apps,
not when running on the open web.

The new transport layer uses the Pepper URLLoader interface, which is
equivalent to a JavaScript XMLHttpRequest. This is allowed for all Native
Client applications. The one drawback is that this requires cooperation with
the git server to return the correct CORS headers. The httpd.py Python server
in the libgit2-demo example shows how to do this.

To use this new transport layer, you must register it with a custom URL scheme.
See the libgit2-demo for an example of this.
