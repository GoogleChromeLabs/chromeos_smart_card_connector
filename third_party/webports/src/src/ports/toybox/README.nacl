This is a simple port of ToyBox.  Many commands have been disabled.

Additionally, where toysh would normally fork itself when running
internal commands, here it will utilize a setjmp trampoline.  This can
result in loss of memory if there are persistent errors.

To spawn a shell, append ?arg1=sh to the URL.
