# TODO(bradnelson): Drop this when we can install things in a more

# location.
# Disabling templatedir as our git package lacks a default template set.
# Setting up a default git identity, since we lack /etc/passwd as
# a fallback.
# Setup default .gitconfig if it doesn't already exist.
# Explictly use [[ ]] conditional here in case coreutils is missing.
