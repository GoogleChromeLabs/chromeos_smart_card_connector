The mesagl example demonstrates how to use the Mesa OpenGL library to port
applications that use pre-OpenGL ES 2.0 APIs for rendering.  The intent of this
example is to help porting efforts that first want to port to NaCl, and then
port to OpenGL ES 2.0

Note that Mesa OpenGL provides software rendering and rasterization only.  The
only way to get hardware accelerated 3D graphics is through Pepper 3D and
OpenGL ES 2.0.

The Mesa OpenGL library for NaCl is available in the naclports project:
