Lua for Chrome
==============

This is package of the Lua interactive shell built to run under Native Client
within Chrome/Chromium.

The NaCl binary is essentially an slightly modfied version of the 'lua'
executable linked with the 'nacl_io' library in order to provide emulated POSIX
I/O within Chrome.  The terminal is rendered in HTML/CSS using hterm
(https://github.com/libapps-mirror/libapps).  See naclterm.js for more
details.

The logo files here are derived from the postscript logo available at:
http://www.lua.org/images/

The PNaCl version is published here:

The NaCl version is published in the Chrome Web Store:

Passing Arguments to Lua
------------------------

Aguments can be passed to Lua via the URL parameters.  For example to run
Lua with the arguments "myfile.lua -v" the URL can be modified to look like::

  index.html?ARG1=myfile.lua&ARG2=-v

URL parameters are converted automatically to environment variables and
variables of form ARG<N> are passed to the executable as part of the argv
array.

Testing
-------

The Lua test suite is installed into the application virtual files system
at startup and is located at "/lua-5.3.0-tests".  The current working
directory is also set to this directory on startup so it is possible to
run all the tests using the following URL::

  index.html?ARG1=all.lua&ARG2=-e_U%3dtrue

For more information on how to running the lua test suite see the lua
teste suite website at http://www.lua.org/tests/.
