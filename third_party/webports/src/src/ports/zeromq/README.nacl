This is a preliminary port of ZeroMQ; because of port and socket permissions
this will not be particularly useful for all use cases to which ZeroMQ would
normally be applied, but it will compile and enable local communication
internal to a process.

Future revisions and integration with nacl_io may enable it to be used as a
websocket provider, easing communication between C/C++/Python libraries with
websockets to the browser.
