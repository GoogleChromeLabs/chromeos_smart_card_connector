quakespasm for Native Client
============================

This port of quake is based on SDL and OpenGL.  By utilising
the SDL port to NaCl and Regal for OpenGL support these are
almost no changes needed to build this game for Native Client.

To run this you need to extract a set of data files into the
directory alongside the executable. The simplest way to get
acquire a data set is to download the shareware episode from
libsdl.org::
