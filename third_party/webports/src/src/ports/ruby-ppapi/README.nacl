Ruby IRB for Chrome
===================

This is package of IRB (the interactive ruby shell) built to
run under Native Client within chrome/chromium.

The logo files here are derived from the SVG logo available at
http://www.ruby.or.jp/en/about/logo/.

Run ./nacl-ruby_ppapi.sh to build IRB for use directly within
chrome (requires the --enable-nacl flag) or via the chome web
store.  The chrome webstore version is published here:
