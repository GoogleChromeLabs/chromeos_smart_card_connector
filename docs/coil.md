COIL (Chrome OS Inclusive Language Program)

Google's open source projects aim to use respectful terms only.

unblocked_terms.txt contains a list of non-inclusive terms currently used in
this repository. After removing all occurences of a non-inclusive term, remove
it from unblocked_terms.txt. This will enable a PRESUBMIT check preventing it
from getting used again in the future.
